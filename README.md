# Intel RealSense Package Downloader 

**A simple package that downloads the newest RealSense Unity Package from the Official Release Page.**

## Why was it created?

I have been using the Intel RealSense SDK for a lot of my projects and wanted to have a way to download the RealSense package from the Unity Packages window. 

## How can the package be Improved?

Ideally, this package would not be required and RealSense would update their repo to support the new Unity Package System. Until then, here are a list of item that still need to be done:
- Use the GitHub API to download the package and release notes.
- Show an update notification if the a new version was released.
